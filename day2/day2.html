        Oh no, Santa's Gravity Assist system is down! We need to run an intcode
        system to fix itself so Santa doesn't crash into the moon!

      <p>Oh no! Fuel also requires fuel!</p>
      <h2>New Problem:</h2>
      <p class="problem">
        Uh oh, the elves realised that fuel ALSO requires fuel and we didn't

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The total amount of fuel required is... <span id="answer2"></span>!
