      <p>Find the total fuel!</p>
      <h2>The Problem:</h2>
      <p class="problem">
        The elves need to find out how much fuel Santa will need to be able to
        make his deliveries! Given a list of different masses, figure out the
        amount of fuel needed by using the formula: (mass / 3) - 2, rounded
        down!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The amount of fuel needed is... <span id="answer1"></span>!
      </p>

      <p>Oh no! Fuel also requires fuel!</p>
      <h2>New Problem:</h2>
      <p class="problem">
        Uh oh, the elves realised that fuel ALSO requires fuel and we didn't
        account for that! Apparently negative or 0 fuel doesn't cost fuel. So we
        need to keep figuring out how much fuel to add so Santa doesn't run out!

        The total amount of fuel required is... <span id="answer2"></span>!
